      "message": "Nearly all of the profiles in our test corpus produce expected values for this function. Most of the -1 results come from fuzzer-generated profiles. Two CMYK printer profiles include the single-channel TRC tag. I\u0027ve re-read the spec, and I can\u0027t find any justification for including that, so I\u0027m inclined to leave this as-is. We could also just ignore the TRC information in the presence of A2B?",

      "message": "According to the specification the `kTRC` (`grayTRCTag`) applies only to monochromatic inputs and outputs. I suppose this could be used somewhere to target a monochromatic output (like reducing the CMYK to grey for printing to a monochromatic printer), though I suppose one would need to dig through the data to see if it is used this way. It doesn\u0027t appear the appearance of an \"inapplicable\" TRC should affect (or invalidate) the number of channels?",
