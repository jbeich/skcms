      "message": "Heads-up: I am not 100% sure anymore if this CL is necessary.\n\nAdding `GA_88` support to `skcms` was necessary to support changing the pixel format via `skcms_Transform` - this was the approach taken in https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/4720150/38/third_party/rust/png/bindings/bindings.cc).  OTOH, we have now pivoted to hiding the `png` crate behind `SkCodec` API and in this world it may be preferable to do color/pixel format transformations via `SkSwizzler` (similarly to what `SkPngCodec` does, maybe reusing some code if possible).\n\nDo you think that adding `GA_88` is still desirable even if it is not needed to support Rust `png` crate?",
