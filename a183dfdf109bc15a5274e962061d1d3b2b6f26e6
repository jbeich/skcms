      "message": "@brianosman, can you PTAL?\n\nNote that this CL is **not** ready to land yet - the CQ seems to report some ASAN-related failures at https://skia-review.googlesource.com/c/skcms/+/880812?tab\u003dchecks - e.g. https://chromium-swarm.appspot.com/task?id\u003d6af59f8eb4b93910.\n\nQUESTION: Could you please help me figure out how to locally run `skcms` tests (i.e. `skcms/tests.c`) under ASAN, from `skcms` repo?  I assume this means using Bazel (since it seems that `skcms` doesn\u0027t have `gn` support in it).  I\u0027ve found https://skia.org/docs/dev/testing/xsan/ but I was unable to follow the instructions there (trouble with gcloud quota + the instructions seem `gn`-focused).",
