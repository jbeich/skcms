IIUC, the target data in ICC profiles is stored as big endian, and we want to read it into little-endian or big-endian based on the architecture. WDYT about `big_u16_to_native` as the name (drop the trailing underscore regardless - it\u0027s not in Skia\u0027s style)?\n\nhttps://www.color.org/icc32.pdf",
